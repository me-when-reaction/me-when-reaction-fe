# Frequently Asked Questions (maybe)

## How do you decide if the reaction is mature or explicit?

TLDR: guesses,

But in short:
- ðŸŸ¢ GENERAL
  - Edible with almost no context
  - Baby Food graded
  - Even snowflakes will not get triggered

- ðŸŸ¡ MATURE
  - Sensitive topic (ðŸŒˆ, politics, religious beliefs)
  - Needs an essay of context
  - Skibidi, gyatt, or other f-ing brainrot. Keep the kids safe

- ðŸ”´ EXPLICIT
  - The joke is corn
  - Neuron activation

## Where can I upload my own image?

In short, I cannot answer as there are lots to add before allowing any user to upload. For now, uploads are available only for me, so only people that knew me personally can contribute to this website.
That is also why that login feature is severely restricted to people that I entrusted with.

I have a great trust issue and thank you for your understanding ðŸ¥°

## Would I be able to upload my reaction personally?

Yes, but not in a short time.

## Why the limit of the reaction is just 10Kb / why the image is so ðŸ’©?

I am broke and any resources that I use was limited by a paywall (i.e. I only use free-tier ðŸ˜­). Hence, I need to reserve some space so I can store much more images.

## Who are you? Where are your contacts?

Just a boi who loves to do things enjoyable.
I don't provide any contacts although a simple OSINT using the URL will do.
